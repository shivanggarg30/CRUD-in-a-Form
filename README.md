This is a simple, client-side CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using HTML and JavaScript . It allows users to:

    Add new user records

    View all users in a table

    Edit existing user information

    Delete unwanted records

All data is stored in memory using a JavaScript array (users) and displayed dynamically in the browser.
